    <h1 style="text-align:center">Crime statistics in U.S.</h1>
    <p>
        Crime in the United States has been recorded since colonization. Crime rates have varied over time, with a sharp rise after 1900, reaching a broad bulging peak between 
		the 1970s and early 1990s. Since then, crime has declined significantly and remains moderate at best nationwide, with such crime rates continuing such a decline to this 
		day. Since 1994 crime rates have steadily decreased, before rising up after 2015 until 2018. From 2018 to 2019, crime rates have recontinued at a steady decline. Statistics
		on specific crimes are indexed in the annual Uniform Crime Reports by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and by annual National Crime Victimization Surveys by the 
		Bureau of Justice Statistics. In addition to the primary Uniform Crime Report known as Crime in the United States, the FBI publishes annual reports on the status of law 
		enforcement in the United States. The report's definitions of specific crimes are considered standard by many American law enforcement agencies. According to the FBI, index
		crime in the United States includes violent crime and property crime. Violent crime consists of five criminal offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, rape, robbery,
		aggravated assault, and gang violence; property crime consists of burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson.

    <h3 style="text-align:center">Purpose of this Site</h3>
    <p>
		Since 1930, the FBI has been collecting data on the types, amounts, and impact of crime in the United States through the Uniform Crime Reporting Program. This program is 
		the most reliable source of crime statistics for law enforcement administration, operation, and management. It is also used by researchers, politicians, and criminal 
		justice professionals to gain a deeper understanding of crime and society. The purpose of this site is to get a closer look at how crime statistics are used and why 
		they are important.

        <h2>U.S. Homicide crime statistics</h2>
        <p>
			In the United States, the law for murder varies by jurisdiction. In most US jurisdictions there is a hierarchy of acts, known collectively as homicide,
			of which first-degree murder and felony murder are the most serious, followed by second-degree murder, followed by voluntary manslaughter and involuntary 
			manslaughter which are not as serious, and ending finally in justifiable homicide, which is not a crime. However, because there are at least 52 relevant 
			jurisdictions, each with its own criminal code, this is a considerable simplification.Sentencing also varies widely depending upon the specific murder charge. 
			"Life imprisonment" is a common penalty for first-degree murder, but its meaning varies widely. Capital punishment is a legal sentence in 28 states, 
			and in the federal civilian and military legal systems. The United States is unusual in actually performing executions, with 34 states having performed 
			executions since capital punishment was reinstated in 1976. The methods of execution have varied, but the most common method since 1976 has been lethal injection.
			In 2019 a total of 22 people were executed, and 2,652 people were on death row.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to a 2013 reports, between 2005 and 2012, the average homicide rate in the U.S. was 4.9 per 100,000 inhabitants compared to the average rate globally,
			which was 6.2. However, the U.S. had much higher murder rates compared to other developed countries, which all had average homicide rates of 0.8 per 100,000.
			In 2004, there were 5.5 homicides for every 100,000 persons, roughly three times as high as Canada (1.9) and six times as high as Germany and Italy (0.9).
			A closer look at The National Archive of Criminal Justice Data indicates that per capita homicide rates over the last 30 plus years on average, of major cities, 
			New Orleans' average annual per capita homicide rate of 52 murders per 100,000 people overall (1980–2012) is the highest of U.S. cities with average annual homicide 
			totals that were among the top 10 highest during the same period.
			In 2018, the US murder rate was 5.0 per 100,000, for a total of 15,498 murders.

        <h2>Property Crime Data</h2>
        <p>
            Property crime is a category of crime, usually involving private property, that includes, among other crimes, burglary, larceny, theft, motor vehicle theft, arson, 
			shoplifting, and vandalism. Property crime is a crime to obtain money, property, or some other benefit. This may involve force, or the threat of force, in cases like 
			robbery or extortion. Since these crimes are committed in order to enrich the perpetrator they are considered property crimes. Crimes against property are divided into
			two groups: destroyed property and stolen property. When property is destroyed, it could be called arson or vandalism. Examples of the act of stealing property is 
			robbery or embezzlement.Property crimes are high-volume crimes, with cash, electronics (e.g. televisions), power tools, cameras, and jewelry often targeted.
			"Hot products" tend to be items that are concealable, removable, available, valuable, and enjoyable, with an ease of "disposal" being the most important characteristic.
        </p>
		<p>
            In 2019, there were 3,007,739 property crime incidents, and 3,022,701 offenses reported by the United States by 8,536 law enforcement agencies that submitted incident-based 
			(NIBRS) glossary lookup data, and covers 44% of the total population. For the third consecutive year, the estimated number of violent crimes in the nation decreased 
			when compared with the previous year’s statistics, according to FBI figures released on September 28. In 2019, violent crime was down 0.5% from the 2018 number. 
			Property crimes also dropped 4.1%, marking the 17th consecutive year the collective estimates for these offenses declined. The 2019 statistics show the estimated rate 
			of violent crime was 366.7 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants, and the estimated rate of property crime was 2,109.9 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants. 
			The violent crime rate fell 1.0% when compared with the 2018 rate; the property crime rate declined 4.5%.

        <h2>Arrest data</h2>
        <p>
			The UCR Program collects information on crimes reported by law enforcement agencies regarding the violent crimes of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery,
			and aggravated assault, as well as the property crimes of burglary, larceny-theft, motor vehicle theft, and arson. (The FBI classifies arson as a property crime but 
			does not estimate arson data because of variations in the level of participation by the reporting agencies. Consequently, arson data is not included in the property 
			crime estimate.) The program also collects arrest data for the offenses listed above and 20 offenses that include all other crimes except traffic violations.
            
        </p>

			For the third consecutive year, the estimated number of violent crimes in the nation decreased when compared with the previous year’s statistics, according to FBI figures

			these offenses declined. The 2019 statistics show the estimated rate of violent crime was 366.7 offenses per 100,000 inhabitants, and the estimated rate of property crime
