    <p>
        The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program generates reliable statistics for use in law enforcement. 
        It also provides information for students of criminal justice, researchers, the media, and the public.
        The program has been providing crime statistics since 1930.
    </p>
    <p>
        The UCR Program includes data from more than 18,000 city, university and college, county, state, tribal, and federal law enforcement agencies. 
        Agencies participate voluntarily and submit their crime data either through a state UCR program or directly to the FBI's UCR Program.

    <h3 style="text-align:center">Purpose of this Site</h3>
    <p>
        While this information is freely available for anyone to see through open-source libraries, the data is often presented in
        different time and value formats that make trend-analysis not easy to digest. The purpose of this site is to provide 
        This information can be digested at a macro level, by seeing
        <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Graphs">Visualize</a> or easily dragged into a comparison to analyze raw numbers at a yearly level, see <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Reports">Years</a> and save some years.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data collected for this site contains all years from 2009 to 2019, and has been categorized and cataloged into a functional <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="AboutUs">Data Model</a>
        to enable future functionality and displays.
